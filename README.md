# TrafficDataParser
This is the package "Traffic Data Parser". It aims to provide a handy toolbox for users to handle and process the traffic data downloaded from Freeway Bureau, MOTC (台灣交通部高速公路局).

I am still working on writing the details of this package. 
See you later.


## How to install

pip install git+https://github.com/HsuanChih-Wang/TrafficDataParser.git
